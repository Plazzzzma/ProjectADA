    "__Inspection date__: This is the date the inspection occurred. A particular establishment is likely to have multiple inspections which are denoted by different inspection dates.  \n",
    "__Inspection type__: An inspection can be one of the following types:\n",
    " - *canvass*: the most common type of inspection performed at a frequency relative to the risk of the establishment.\n",
    " - *consultation*: when the inspection is done at the request of the owner prior to the opening of the establishment. \n",
    " - *complaint*: when the inspection is done in response to a complaint against the establishment.\n",
    " - *license*: when the inspection is done as a requirement for the establishment to receive its license to operate.\n",
    " - *suspect food poisoning* when the inspection is done in response to one or more persons claiming to have gotten ill as a result of eating at the establishment (a specific type of complaintbased inspection).\n",
    " - *task-force inspection* when an inspection of a bar or tavern is done.\n",
    "Re-inspections can occur for most types of these inspections and are indicated as such.    \n",
    "\n",
    "__Results__: An inspection can pass, pass with conditions or fail. Establishments receiving a ‘pass’ were found to have no critical or serious violations (violation number 1-14 and 15- 29, respectively). Establishments receiving a ‘pass with conditions’ were found to have critical or serious violations, but these were corrected during the inspection. Establishments receiving a ‘fail’ were found to have critical or serious violations that were not correctable during the inspection. An establishment receiving a ‘fail’ does not necessarily mean the establishment’s licensed is suspended. Establishments found to be out of business or not located are indicated as such.\n",
    "__Violations__: An establishment can receive one or more of 45 distinct violations (violation numbers 1-44 and 70). For each violation number listed for a given establishment, the requirement the establishment must meet in order for it to NOT receive a violation is noted, followed by a specific description of the findings that caused the violation to be issued."
