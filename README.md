# Project ADA - Chicagoan Restaurants
Beyond the menu: where to eat in Chicago?

## Abstract

Ranking third in the list of the United States’ most populous cities, Chicago is renowned for witnessing the nascence of the most popular dishes in North-American cuisine. The city has built itself a solid reputation in the food-related field with the quite numerous restaurants and food establishments it features. Yet, it is not always easy to know, neither for locals nor for tourists, where to eat best by Lake Michigan!
Relying on the results of the Department of Public Health’s inspection and on a sentiment analysis in online reviews, we intend to establish an interactive map that enables us to know where the safest options to eat in Chicago are. Moreover, the data will be paired with the locations of reported incidents of crime in order to understand whether there is, or not, a pattern that links the quality of food provided to the safeness of a neighborhood. 

## Research questions
The work will be directed in a way to answer the following questions:

* Is there an observable pattern in the spatial distribution of food establishments presenting low (resp. high) risk rates in the city of Chicago? * If that is the case, has it evolved over time?

* Is there any correlation between the quality of food provided in an establishment and the crime rate in the surrounding neighborhood? * Do the comments and reviews on open online platforms reflect the results of the inspection undertaken in the corresponding establishment?

## Datasets

In order to provide answers to the above listed questions, we will rely on the following datasets:

#### Chicago Food Inspections:
This dataset presents the results of inspections undertaken by the Chicago Department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program since 2010 up until today. Having both the address and the exact geographical coordinates for each inspected establishment, we will try and visualize the spatial distribution of restaurants that offer food of good (resp. poor) quality. 

#### Crimes – 2001 to present
The data being presented both as a dataset and a map, we will exploit them in order to determine whether there is or not a correlation between the quality of food provided and the crime rate in a certain neighborhood. Only incidents reported in the relevant period of time will be taken into consideration. 

#### Reviews and comments on [platform]
The data will be sorted in a sentiment analysis in order to see if the public opinion on a specific restaurant is in adequacy or not with the results of its inspection.

## A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

We sure want the work to be done, until then we will try and progressively achieve the following milestones:

#### Prepare the data

* Download datasets

* Collect data for the sentiment analysis

* Filter and clean data in order to keep results issued in the same timespan

#### Visualize the data

* Establish an interactive map of food establishment showing the inspection results

* Add the crime hotspots to that same map

* Figure out a way to pair results of both inspection and sentiment analysis

#### Notebook

* Keep track of the progression of the work

* Analyze and interpret results

* Make analysis understandable for anyone
